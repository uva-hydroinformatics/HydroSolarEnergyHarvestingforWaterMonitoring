Ice effects from partial ice cover or shore ice may be minor, where stage and discharge appear to increase at night and decrease to base-line conditions around midday for one or more days. Major ice effects from complete ice cover appear as constantly increasing stage and discharge over several days during prolonged cold periods. Stage and discharge values for streams experiencing minor ice effects will continue to be displayed on the web to enable the user to estimate the approximate base-line discharges. Note that this method of estimation should only be used when no runoff occurs. During periods of major ice effects, display of discharge data on the web will be temporarily discontinued to prevent misuse of erroneous discharge data. The discharge record will resume when it is determined that ice conditions are no longer present.
